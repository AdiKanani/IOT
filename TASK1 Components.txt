
Designing an IoT-based car parking management system using Arduino requires a combination of hardware components and code. 
The system can utilize sensors to detect parking space availability and communicate that information to a central server
or display unit. Here's a simplified example of how you could implement such a system using Arduino components:

Components Needed:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Ultrasonic distance sensors (HC-SR04)
Wi-Fi module (ESP8266)
LEDs or LCD display (for visual feedback)
Breadboard and jumper wires
